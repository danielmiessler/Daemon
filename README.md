## Purpose

The purpose of the Daemon project is to help entities of any sort—but especially people—share what they care about with the world.

The project partners with [Substrate](https://github.com/human-substrate/substrate) to provide a referencable list of things that matter to humans.

## Content

The current content of the Daemon framework is a list of potential endpoints as we build out the project.

```python
/ideas
/favorite_books
/skills
/problems
/hobbies
/looking_for
```

## How to Contribute

The best way to contribute today is to add an Issue to the repo with your ideas for how to expand the list of API endpoints for the project.

## Next steps

1. Continue building out the structure.
2. Decide on a tech stack for publishing these APIs for people.
3. Build and publish the stack framework here on the project.
